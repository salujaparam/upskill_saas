It is an app where all developers can meet and contact
with each other. There is a pro subscription plan and a
basic subscription plan to the website.

A developer can contact to the owner with the help of the
contact form which uses a mail-gun addon provided by 
heroku which makes the mailing process happen.

The app is made in a rails environment provided to us 
by cloud9 which is a cloud-based integrated development
environment (IDE) that lets us write, run, and debug our
code with just a browser.
